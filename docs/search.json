    "text": "It is possible to track the visits to your webpage and how the users engage with the page. Getting this tracking one your webpage is relatively easy. There are however several laws in the EU with GDPR that sets several requirements for the handeling of this data that are harder to implement on the webpage. I have tried, but not found out exactly how to do it yet. The following page will therefore detail my journey so far and what I have learned. I will hopefully figure it out one day and update this page. In the meantime, it will just be a collection of my knowledge up until now. I also have not by any means a full overview of how to make something GDPR compliant, so this is not sufficient to make something GDPR compliant, you have to do some individual research or get help from someone more qualified than me for that.\nGetting the tracking of the webpage Google analytics is a free tool that allows you to track users on your webpage. It is very easy to set up. You just create an account on Google Analytics for your webpage and link it to your webpage. Then in the _quarto.yml file, you add the following: “website: google-analytics: tracking-id:”G-XXXXXXXXX”” You get the tracking id from Google Analytics and this id will be individual for each of us.\nThat is all you need to set up the tracking on your webpage. If you visit you page, you can now see that it registers you as a user and put up some statistics about it.\nAdding cookie consent One of the biggest challenges with getting the tracking to be GDPR compliant with Quarto is to ask for cookie consent and get Google Analytics to not collect information if the user does not consent.\nTo add the banner asking for consent in Quarto, add the following to the _quarto.yml file: “website: cookie-consent: type: express” This cookie banner is however very standard and offer little flexibility. It does for example state that we use cookies to personalize ads, which is not the case for the current webpage.\nI saw someone write a javascript script to change out this text. That involves adding the following line to the _quarto.yml file: “format: html: include-in-header: - file: header.html”\nand creating a header.html file with the following content: “\n\n”\nand changing the cookie title and cookie text to what fits your webpage.\nAfter doing all of this, it looked like Google Analytics was collecting data whether I agreed or disagreed to the cookies, so I was unsure of whether it was working or not. My suspicion was that Google Analytics might not get the information about whether the cookies were agreed to or not from Quarto, and I am not sure how to fix that. I tried asking ChatGPT which got me to add the following file: “// Initialize Google Consent Mode with denied consent by default window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\ngtag(‘consent’, ‘default’, { analytics_storage: ‘denied’, ad_storage: ‘denied’, wait_for_update: 500 });\n// Update consent when the user accepts cookies document.addEventListener(“DOMContentLoaded”, function () { document.addEventListener(“cookieconsent:accepted”, function () { gtag(‘consent’, ‘update’, { analytics_storage: ‘granted’ }); }); });” as consent.js and add that file to the _quarto.yml file like I did with header.html. However, after doing this (and trying some other things), it didn’t look like Google Analytics was collecting any data anymore.\nI asked ChatGPT how to check whether things worked like it should and it said to open the page in incognito mode, open my webpage, and then the web developer tools. To then click on “Application” and look for the _ga tag which should be there when I consent, but not when I do not consent. Instead, I found the following message there “Cookie “_ga” has been rejected for invalid domain.”. At this point, I am not sure what to do moving forward. I have also tried so many things, that I am not sure what created the problem to begin with. Therefore, I think the easiest the next time I am working on this is to just start over going over these steps and testing things as I go. Then if nothing else works, maybe ask someone. In the meantime, I have deleted all code and accounts that was created for this experiment, as I have all the information I need to recreate it from this file. Good luck!\nSOURCES: - Documentation on adding cookie banner and Google Analytics to Quarto - Link and Link - Code for creating the javascript for changing the text on the cookie banner - Link",

Add some text and the content you want to the page and save it.\nThen, to add the page to your webpage, you need to tell Quarto where you want the page featured. You can do this in the “_quarto.yml” file. Under “website”, you can see that it already has the text: “navbar: left: - href: index.qmd text: Home - about.qmd” This text tells Quarto to make a navigation bar, which you can already see on your webpage at the top. There should be two tabs, one called “Home” and one called “About”. The above code has added these two pages to the webpage, by mapping them to the navigation bar at the top, as its one tab. You can add another tab by adding another line under “about.qmd” on the same indent level and write “-”, a space, and the name of the qmd file you created. If you now save the “_quarto.yml” file and render the website from the build tab, you will see that your page has appeared as another tab.",

    "title": "Customizing the Webpage",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There are many things you can do to customize your webpage. Here we will go over some of them.\nThe first thing is to customize the navigation bars. There are two types of navigation bars: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal navigation bars are the tabs you already see on your webpage. In addition, you can have vertical navigation bars, which are on the side.\nTo create the tabs on the top, you add this text to your yml file under the website attribute: “navbar: tools: menu: - about.qmd - index.qmd”\nTo create the vertical navigation option, you add this text to your yml file under the website attribute: “sidebar: contents: - about.qmd - index.qmd”\nIt is possible to have only one at a time or both together (which I will get back to later).\nIn addition, there are many options to customize the navigation bars:\nIn the _quarto.yml file, you can change the margin on the pages. Add ” page-layout: article” under “format and html”. By default (if you don’t specify page-layout), it will use article, which leaves about 7 cm of white space on the right side of the screen when you open each page. You can change it to full, which makes the text use all of the page. If you are like me, you would like something in-between, you can remove the page-layout option and instead add “grid:” with the suboption “margin-width: 100px”. The higher the number, the more white space you will get on the right side of the screen. You can also customize the size of the other sizes under the grid attribute, such as “sidebar-width” (the navigation bar on the side), “body-width” (the size of the area with your main text), and “gutter-width” (the size between each area, such as the navigation bar,the body of the text, and the table of contents). If you start changing one of these options though, that will shift everything. So it is better to either just use “page-layout” or all of the four page options. This webpage uses the following values: ” grid: sidebar-width: 275px body-width: 2000px margin-width: 100px gutter-width: 1rem”\nChanging the title of the pages You can change the title of the qmd file in the yml header and this is then the title that will be displayed both in the navigation bar and on the webpage. If you for some reason want to display a different name in the navigation bar than on the page, you can change this in the navigation bar. So far, you have in your _quarto.yml document used a dash (-) and the file name to add to the navigation bar. If you want a different title, you can split an entry up and change for example “- about.qmd” to: “- text:”About” href: about.qmd”\nChanging the themes of the webpage Quarto has several built-in themes that you can use to change the colors and font of your webpage. You can see the built in options here. By default, Quarto uses Cosmo, but you can change that to any of the other themes. I have for example used the theme Flatly for this webpage. You can even have a webpage for light and one for dark mode. To do this, use the following code: “theme: light: flatly dark: darkly” This creates a toggle in your top nav bar where users can switch between dark and light mode.\nYou might have noticed that Quarto chooses two themes by defualt: cosmo and brand. Brand is not a default theme, so I think this is an option to create your own customized options in a brand document that then gets linked. If you plan on doing this, you might want to keep the “brand”, if not, you can safely delete it. Here is further information about creating your own brand document.\nChanging the themes of the webpage affects the color choices. If you have a top navigation bar (with tabs) this will for example by default go to the “light” option in your theme. Most of the themes are made to instead use the “primary” color, so you can change this the color of the nav bar to primary, or any other color in your theme, by adding “background: primary” under navbar in the _quarto.yml file.\nYou can also change the color of the side bar with the same background option, but this can create some challenges with the margins being white, so it does typically look better to keep it as the same color as the background color.\nYou can further customize the templates you are using by adding your own theme file, for example as “light: [flatly, theme.scss]”. The options to include in the scss file can easily be googled to further customize the page, for example with a different link color. I have just stuck with the theme, so I have not explored this further. If you are interested in doing these further customizations though, check out the Quarto documentation page and this course in advanced sutomization usin SASS.\nLinking to other pages You can link to a different page on a page the same way you would link to a URL. You use square brackets around the text you want displayed over the link, then without any spaces, you have a parenthesis with the file name for the page you want to link to, such as about.qmd. You can see it in action here. If you have headings and sections formatted on the page, you can also link to that specific page by adding #section_name right after the file name. If I had for example had a section for “cv” on my about page, linking to that section would look like this “about.qmd#cv”.\nCreate a web tab icon You can specify an icon that will be displayed in the tab of the webpage when people look at your webpage. To add this, you first need to get a png file with the icon or logo you want, preferrably with a transparent background. Then, save it in your project folder. I recommend making a separate folder for pictures, for example called “pics”. Then add the favicon attribute under webpages with the link to get from where your R project file is to the picture you want and the file name of the picture. In my case, it looks like the following: “website: favicon: pics/logo/Binary_code.png”\nSOURCES - Customizing Rmarkdown documents - Link - Customizing Quarto webpages - Link - Introduction to creating a Quarto webpage, hosting it on GitHub, and customizing the page - Link - Instructions on customizing the layout of a Quarto document (or page) - Link - Values for the page layout - Link - Overview of the built-in Quarto themes - Link",

    "text": "The following page will detail how to make a webpage with Rstudio that is hosted online through Git Hub. The web page can then be visited by other people by using your URL, just like you are doing on this web page. The steps to set it up are relatively easy, but they do require a little bit of back and forth. Once you have created the webpage, it is easier to work on it. The first steps are therefore the most time consuming.\nIn the following tutorial, I will use the following programs: - Rstudio - GitHub - Optional: Git terminal\nYou can create a webpage just by using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). However, when you render your webpage, it will just be saved locally on your computer, so other people cannot access the webpage unless they also have all the files that you have. You have therefore then only created the internal structure of the webpage and not published it online. To get it online so that other people can access it, you have to save your work in a Git repository that is hosted on GitHub and then publish the pages through GitHub. Your webpage will then get an URL with the word github in it, as it is hosted on github.\nCreating a webpage in Quarto is very easy. Likewise, creating a Git repository is also very easy. Unfortunately, creating a webpage that is also a repository and getting them to talk to each other is more complicated. However, this guide will walk you through it, so just be patient with it and we will get there together.\nThe first step is to make a Git repository. It is also possible to make the webpage first (which makes making the webpage easier, but that creates more steps in GitHub and as Rstudio is easier to understand and navigate than GitHub, I would rather take extra steps in Rstudio than in GitHub). If you however are dead set on creating the webpage first and then the repository, this link might be helpful: https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first. Personally, I saw others online indicating that it is easier to make the repository first, so I just deleted my R project and started with the repository.\nSo, make the repository in GitHub first.\nThen, you want to add a R project to the repository in Rstudio. To do this, open Rstudio, create a new project, and chose “Version Control” and then “Git”. Then it asks you for the URL of the remote repository. You can get this by going to your repository in GitHub and clicking the green “Code” button. This will show you a link starting with https. Copy the link and paste it into the box in Rstudio. The name of the project will then automatically update to the name of your repository from the link. Then you chose where to save this project and the local repository in your files.\nNow, you have created a local repository. However, the new files (such as .gitignore and your r project file) are not included in your local repository by git yet, so you need to stage these files, commit them, and push them to the remote repository.\nThen you can start getting the internal structure of the webpage into your folder. There are two ways to do this, and I recommend the second one. 1. You can create the necessary files: _quatro.yml, about.qmd, index.qmd, styles.css, and _site. They do not have a lot of content, so this is not impossible to do 2. You can create a new R project (that you later delete) and choose “Quarto website” of the options. Then by using file explorer, you can copy the above mentioned files and folders and paste them into the R project for your webpage. Then you can delete the R project you just created to get the files, for example in file explorer. If you are planning on creating multiple webpages, you can save these files in a folder and copy these to the relevant R projects as you create webpages. Then you won’t have to always create a new temporary R project and delete it later.\nWhen you have the files in the R project, open _quarto.yml in Rstudio and find the top section that says: “project: type: website”\nadd the line “output-dir: docs” so that it now says: “project: type: website output-dir: docs”\nWe do this because your output files (html) that gets shown on your webpage are saved in the _site folder by Rstudio initially, but GitHub expects a folder called “Docs”, so we need to tell Rstudio to create the folder “Docs” and save the output pages there, so that GitHub will find them.\nAfter you have done all this, you can build your webpage. On the top right pane in Rstudio, you can see a tab called “Build”. Click on this tab and click on “Render Website”. It will take a litle bit and then a new window will open showing you the webpage you have so far. This is the local webpage, meaning that you have now made your webpage, but that it is not hosted online yet. Stage, commit, and push these changes now.\nThe next step is then to host the webpage online. To do this, go to GitHub and your repository. Click on the “Settings” tab and scroll down to “Pages” on the left side. Where it says “None”, click on it and select “Main”. Then next to it, click on the scroll down menu and select “Docs”. Then click “Save” and wait for GitHub to create the webpage. This might take some time. When the webpage is created, you will see a green banner and the “Pages” page will also update to have your URL. If you click on the URL you can now see your webpage as hosted online. If you share this URL with others, they can now also see and access your webpage.\nCongratulations, you have now created your first webpage and published it online!\nThe next steps now will be to customize your webpage. We will go over that in the next section.\nMoving onward, you can create new pages and customize a lot. However, it is very important that you never change the name, move, or delete the _quarto.yml, index.qmd, and docs folder (if hosting the webpage on GitHub). You would also likely want the styles.css file to get the right layout of your pages.\nOne thing that is cool with your webpage, is that it will automatically update the layout to work on mobile phones, so you can create your layout the way you want it on the computer and then Quarto customize it again to work on a mobile phone as necessary.\nSOURCES: - Building the webpage manually in Rmarkdown instead of with Quarto - Link - Introduction to creating a Quarto webpage, hosting it on GitHub, and customizing the page - Link - Quarto’s documentation on creating and customizing webpages - Link - How to connect the R project and GitHub if you create the R project first - Link - Instructions on how to host the webpage on GitHub - Link",
